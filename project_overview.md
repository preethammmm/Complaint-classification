üóÇÔ∏è Complaint Classification Project
üîç Purpose: Efficient Complaint Management and Analysis
This project is built to automate and streamline the classification of customer complaints. Instead of relying on manual tagging or routing, I've developed an AI-powered system that can understand the content of a complaint and assign it to a relevant issue category. The ultimate goal is to improve efficiency, reduce response times, and enhance overall customer service operations.

 Who This Project Is For?
- Customer Service Teams
They can use the system to receive pre-categorized complaints, allowing them to focus on resolving issues more quickly instead of spending time understanding or routing them.
- Support Managers
This tool offers a high-level overview of complaint categories and trends. Managers can use it to allocate resources more effectively, identify common issues, and prioritize service improvements.
- Data Analysts
Categorized complaints provide valuable data for analytics. Analysts can track complaint types over time, monitor recurring problems, and measure the impact of business decisions.
- Product Development Teams
Recurring complaint categories can help highlight product pain points and inform development priorities‚Äîleading to better design and user experience.

Example usecaase:

Real-World Use Case: "Tech Solutions Inc."
Let‚Äôs say ‚ÄúTech Solutions Inc.‚Äù receives hundreds of support tickets daily. Previously, complaints were triaged manually, which led to:

Time-consuming processes
Inconsistent categorization
Scalability issues
Delayed responses due to misrouting

Now, with this Complaint Classifier:

A customer (e.g., Sarah) submits a complaint about her cloud storage quota being incorrect.
The system ingests her complaint text.
The AI model analyzes it, identifying key terms like ‚Äúcloud storage,‚Äù ‚Äúquota,‚Äù and ‚Äúerror.‚Äù
It classifies the issue as ‚ÄúCloud Storage Billing/Quota Issue‚Äù with high confidence.
The ticket is automatically routed to the appropriate support team.
The issue is resolved faster and more accurately, leading to better customer satisfaction.
Over time, the categorized data offers powerful insights for both the support and product teams.


Standout Features
Multi-Class Text Classification
This system classifies complaints into predefined categories like "Credit card," "Mortgage," or "Checking or savings account." I use TF-IDF for text representation and models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, with a focus on handling imbalanced data.

Streamlit UI Highlights
Here's how a customer service agent or admin interacts with the system:

Input Area: A large textbox to paste/type the complaint.
Classify Button: Click to generate a prediction.
Predicted Category Display: Shows the model's result clearly.
Confidence Score: Optional display of prediction certainty (e.g., ‚ÄúConfidence: 85%‚Äù).
Raw Prediction Details (optional): Collapsible section with probabilities for all categories.
Feedback Mechanism (planned enhancement): Dropdown or buttons to submit feedback like ‚ÄúCorrect‚Äù or ‚ÄúIncorrect ‚Äì Should be: [category]‚Äù.


 What Sets This Project Apart
 
-Accuracy & Robustness
Focused on real-world complaint text variations (misspellings, informal writing).
Designed to remain reliable across imbalanced class distributions.

-Class Imbalance Handling
Using techniques like class_weight='balanced', SMOTE (if applicable), and smart evaluation metrics (e.g., F1-score) to ensure fair performance across all classes.

-Transparency & Confidence-Aware Predictions
Confidence scores help users understand model certainty and flag low-confidence predictions for human review.

-User Feedback Loop (Future Feature)
A planned mechanism for collecting user corrections will allow for model retraining and continuous improvement.

-Clean & Intuitive UI
Built with Streamlit for easy interaction by non-technical users.

-Explainability (Optional Advanced Feature)
Future additions may include highlighting the words that influenced the prediction most.

-Scalability (Planned Documentation)
Though not yet implemented, I‚Äôll be outlining methods to scale this for enterprise use and integrate it with existing systems.

Why This Project Matters???
This Complaint Classifier transforms unstructured customer complaints into actionable, structured data. By doing so, it supports faster resolutions, better team coordination, data-driven decisions, and continuous service improvement.
Whether you're working in support, management, analysis, or product development, this tool offers real and measurable value.
